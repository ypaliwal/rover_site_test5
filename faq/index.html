                                Rover is designed to allow you as a spot owner to operate within the boundaries of the city’s zoning bylaws. We do not support or encourage the enlargement of residential driveways in order to accommodate more vehicles. The spot(s) you rent out should be those designed and already in place for the parking of your vehicle(s). If you have any questions about these bylaws, you can view them on the city’s web site <a href="http://app.toronto.ca/BLSRWEB_Public/HomePage.do" target="_blank">here</a>.
                                <br><br>The 2 most important  aspects when listing a spot after ensuring your availability and price are as desired is to post a PICTURE of your spot with a clear DESCRIPTION. This will allow renters to know exactly where to put their vehicle. Eg. “Please park on the right side of the driveway if facing the house. Please do not block the garage.”

                                It is very easy to temporarily turn off your spot without affecting your original settings. Simply go to Share Parking and click on your spot. At the bottom you will see an on/off switch which will allow you to turn off the availability. Note: you cannot edit your spot  if someone is currently parked in it.

                                In order to set overnight parking you need to create 2 different parking schedules. For example if you want to make the spot available from 8pm on Monday until 8am on Tuesday you must do the following:
                                <br><br>
                                On the availability screen select Monday at the top. Then select 8pm to 12am. Select the hourly price and hit add.
                                <br><br>
                                Click on add timing & price again. This time select Tuesday and make it available from 12am to 8am. Select price and hit Add. Your spot will now be available from 8pm on Monday until 8am on Tuesday. We call this time stitching and you can do this at any point in the day. We are working on a more user friendly way to create over night spots.

                                Because Parking Owners have the ability to set whatever availability they choose we don’t have rates for Daily or Overnight parking. Instead we apply a discount based on the number of consecutive hours parked. This is a set discount and cannot be changed. Currently the only way for you as a parking owner to check what that discount will look like will be to pretend to book your parking spot. By doing this you will be able to see what the total charge will be for your spot for any given duration. As long as you don’t hit pay you will not be charged.

                                As a parking owner you have the ability to make your spot available whenever you want. This means you could make your spot available 24/7, 9am – 5pm on weekdays, 9am – 9pm on weekends ect. You can also make a spot available at different times on any given day and associate different prices to each time period. 9am – 5pm is $2/hr, 5pm – 9pm at $1.50/hr, 9pm – Midnight at $1/hr.

                                Rover is designed to allow spot owners to operate within the boundaries of the city’s zoning bylaws. We do not support or encourage the enlargement of residential driveways in order to accommodate more vehicles. The spot(s) you rent out should be those designed and already in place for the parking of your vehicle(s). If you have any questions about these bylaws, you can view them on the city’s web site <a href="http://app.toronto.ca/BLSRWEB_Public/HomePage.do" target="_blank">here</a>.

                                The 2 most important  aspects when listing a spot after ensuring your availability and price are as desired is to post a PICTURE of your spot with a clear DESCRIPTION. This will allow renters to know exactly where to put their vehicle. Eg. “Please park on the right side of the driveway if facing the house. Please do not block the garage.
