                                <p>We have implemented a retention policy to prevent personal information from being retained for a period that is longer than reasonably necessary to deliver the products and/or services available on Rover’s Site.

You acknowledge that the amounts payable under this Agreement are based in part on these limitations, and you further agree that these limitations will apply to the full extent permitted by law and irrespective of the nature of the cause of action, demand, or action by you including but not limited to breach of contract, negligence, tort, strict liability or any other legal theory and will survive a fundamental breach or breaches or the failure of the essential purpose of this Agreement or of any remedy contained herein.

                                <ol>
                                    <li>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Rover, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees and agents (“Rover Indemnitees”) from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including but not limited to lawyer’s and accountant’s fees) arising from: (i) your actions or omissions in relation to the Services, the Site, the Parking Space or the Booking; (ii) your violation of any term of this Agreement; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, publicity or privacy right; (iv) any claim that any content uploaded by you to the Site caused damage to a third party; (v) your violation of any law; or (vi) your breach of the Driver/Owner License Agreement. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive this Agreement and your use of the Site. You hereby agree to waive the application of any law that may limit the efficacy of the foregoing agreement to defend and indemnify Rover Indemnitees.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <h4>Limitation of Liability
                                </h4>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Rover will not be liable for any lost profits, loss of data, or costs of procurement of substitute goods or services or for any claim or demand against you by any other party. In no event will Rover be liable for any consequential, special, indirect, or exemplary damages whatsoever arising out of (i) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of the Site or Services, (ii) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to and use of the Site or Services or any Booking with an Owner to the fullest extent permissible by law, (iii) any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal, institutional, technical or other information stored therein, (iv) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Site, (v) any bugs, viruses, Trojan horses, or the like, which may be transmitted to or through the Site by any third party, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of your use of the Site or Services, however caused and under any theory of liability even if we are advised of the possibility of such damages. You acknowledge that the amounts payable under this Agreement are based in part on these limitations, and you further agree that these limitations will apply to the full extent permitted by law and irrespective of the nature of the cause of action, demand, or action by you including but not limited to breach of contract, negligence, tort, strict liability or any other legal theory and will survive a fundamental breach or breaches or the failure of the essential purpose of this agreement or of any remedy contained herein.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>For the avoidance of doubt, the liability excluded under clause 17(i) includes any loss arising from your dealings with any Owner or arising from the Parking Space and we shall have no liability to you whatsoever for any act or omission of the Owner in connection with the Parking Space or your Booking.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Our liability to you for all losses under this Agreement is limited to the total amount paid by you to us (as agent for the Owner) under this Agreement.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>No claim may be brought against us in relation to this Agreement more than 12 months following the Booking to which the claim relates.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>You agree that the above exclusions of liability are reasonable in all the circumstances, especially in light of the fact that our Services include only the provision of the Site and Services and responsibility for the Parking Space and fulfillment of a Booking lies solely with the Owner for whom we act only as an agent in a limited capacity.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The liability excluded under this clause excludes situations where fraud, willful concealment or theft shall be shown to have taken place on our part and nothing in this agreement limits or excludes our liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

                                </p>
                                <ol>

                                    <li>The referred user may not already have an Account (active or inactive) on the Site;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The referred user must sign up for an Account using the activation link of the referral invitation;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>You will not receive rewards if you’re the Driver on a Booking with a person you refer. Additionally, if both a Driver and Owner are referred by you, you will not receive rewards if they book with one another.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Your rewards will be released approximately two weeks after the qualifying Parking Space Booking is made.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>We reserve the right to terminate the Accounts of referring or referred users, if, in our sole discretion, they have acquired rewards by fraud or have used or attempted to use the acquired rewards in a way that violates these Terms.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>We reserve the right to terminate the Program or change the terms at our own discretion at any time.

                                    <li>Both parties shall be released from their respective obligations in the event of national emergency, war, prohibitive governmental regulation or if any other cause beyond the reasonable control of the parties or either of them renders the performance of the Agreement impossible.

                                    <li>Each party acknowledges that the Agreement, including the Privacy Policy, contains the whole agreement between the parties and that it has not relied upon any oral or written representations made to it by the other or its employees or agents and has made its own independent investigations into all matters relevant to it. In particular, it is agreed that any terms and conditions or other contractual documentation maintained by you or your affiliates or which you purport to apply to the subject matter of the Agreement will not apply.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>You agree that these Terms are fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. However, if any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent under law.

                                    <li>No delay, neglect or forbearance on the part of either party in enforcing against the other party any term or condition of this Agreement shall either be or be deemed to be a waiver or in any way prejudice any right of that party under this Agreement. No right, power or remedy in this Agreement conferred upon or reserved for either party is exclusive of any other right, power or remedy available to that party.

                                    <li>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without reference to the principles of conflicts of law.

                                    <li>In the event of a dispute, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the Province of Ontario. Any arbitration, mediation or other conciliatory process must be initiated and carried out in Ontario.

                                    <li>You acknowledge that Rover’s rights and your obligations to Rover are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm Rover and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone so that Rover shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligation of posting any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief and agree to limit your claims to claims for money damages (if any).
